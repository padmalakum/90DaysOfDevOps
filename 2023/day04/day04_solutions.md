Shell scripting is a series of commands which can be run for multiple times at specific periods 
In Devops most of the things which we do regularly are automated through scripting which can save time.
There are lots of tools for automation in Devops but we still need to write some scripting to work with those tools.
examples of scripting are --If we want to do cron jobs that can be automated through scripting
If we want to do backups for  databases then we can write a script and trigger it on specific time.
BAsically #!bin/bash and #!bin/sh are both same bash is having more features and better syntax.So it s always better to use bash.
