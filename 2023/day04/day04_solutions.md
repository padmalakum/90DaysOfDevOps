Shell scripting is a series of commands which can be run for multiple times at specific periods 
In Devops most of the things which we do regularly are automated through scripting which can save time.
There are lots of tools for automation in Devops but we still need to write some scripting to work with those tools.
examples of scripting are --If we want to do cron jobs that can be automated through scripting
